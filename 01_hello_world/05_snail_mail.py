#Create a blank letter.py program.

#In this exercise, you will write a letter to your future self... in Python.

#Take a moment and think about what you hope to achieve on this journey.

#Use print() to output:

#Today's date.
#How you are feeling right now.
#What you want to accomplish by learning to code.
#A little message to your older, wiser, and programmer self.
#Your favorite emoji to spice things up!
#When it's done, take a screenshot and click the Twitter icon to post your letter!

#P.S. We will return the letter when the time is right.
