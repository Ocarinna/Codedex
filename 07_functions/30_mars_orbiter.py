#In September 1999, after ten months of travel to Mars, the Mars Climate Orbiter suddenly burned to pieces because it had entered the atmosphere too fast.

#Oh no! The NASA engineers forgot to convert imperial data to metric data in one of the functions! This noob mistake cost American taxpayers $125 million total.

#Suppose you're a NASA intern, and your team is calculating the distance a rocket needs to travel. The value calculated is in kilometers, while the next step requires miles. Your manager quickly writes this on the board:

#miles= kilometer/1.609

#Create a new file called rocket.py.

#Define a function named distance_to_miles() that converts a distance from kilometers to miles. It should:

#Take in one parameter named distance (the distance in kilometers).
#Print the distance in miles.
#After, call the function and use 10000 as the argument.

def distance_to_miles():
    kilometers = int(input("Qual a distancia em KM? \n"))
    miles= kilometers/1.609
    print("\nDistancia em Milhas é",miles)
